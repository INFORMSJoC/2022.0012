## Description

The goal of this software is to compare the performance of stochastic linearized proximal method of multipliers (**SLPMM**) proposed in the paper with several existing algorithms for minimizing a convex expectation function subject to a set of inequality convex expectation constraints. A preprint of this paper is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11577).

Three numerical examples are tested in this software: 
- Neyman-Pearson classification. 
- Stochastic quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP). 
- Second-order stochastic dominance (SSD)  constrained portfolio optimization.

This software contains three folders: `NP_classification`, `QCQP`, `SSD`. 
- `NP_classification`: solves Neyman-Pearson classification problems.
- `QCQP`: solves stochastic quadratically constrained quadratic programs.
- `SSD`: solves second-order stochastic dominance (SSD)  constrained portfolio optimization problems.

## Results

The results in the paper were generated by this software that had been carried out using MATLAB R2020a on a desktop computer with Intel(R) Xeon(R) E-2124G 3.40GHz and 32GB memory. The MATLAB function *refline* is required which is available in the Statistics Toolbox of MATLAB.

1. The files in folder `NP_classification/results` show the results of comparison between  **CSA**, **YNW**, **PSG**, **APriD** and **SLPMM** for Neyman-Pearson classification.
- Figure 1 in the paper shows the results of comparison of algorithms on dataset *gisette*.
- Figure 2 in the paper shows the results of comparison of algorithms on dataset *CINA*.
- Figure 3 in the paper shows the results of comparison of algorithms on dataset *MNIST*.

2. The files in folder `QCQP/results` show the results of comparison between   **YNW**, **PSG**, **APriD** and **SLPMM** for stochastic quadratically constrained quadratic programming.
- Figure 4 in the paper shows the results of comparison of algorithms on stochastic quadratically constrained quadratic programming.


3. The files in folder `SSD/results` show the results of comparison between   **YNW**, **PSG**, **APriD**, **PALEM** and **SLPMM** for SSD constrained portfolio optimization.
- Figure 5 in the paper shows the results of comparison of algorithms on SSD constrained portfolio optimization.

## Replicating

- To replicate the results in Figure 1-3, run the `NP_classification/test_NP_classification_logloss.m` script.
- To replicate the results in Figure 4, run the `QCQP/test_QCQP.m` script.
- To replicate the results in Figure 5, run the `SSD/test_portfolio_SSD.m` script (run `SSD/mex_x.m` first).

## Remark
 The elapsed cpu time of the experiments is much longer than that is shown in the figures (pure time of the algorithms). The reason is that we have to track the true values of objective and constraint functions at each iteration to show the performance of the algorithms, thus the code is very time-consuming.  Each pure time shown in the figures equals to the total time minus the time for computing  the true values of objective and constraint functions.
